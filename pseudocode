pseudocode:

on Init
  public chain ← publicly known blocks
  private chain ← publicly known blocks
  privateBranchLen ← 0
  Mine at the head of the private chain.
  
on My pool found a block
  ∆prev ← length(private chain) − length(public chain)
  append new block to private chain
  privateBranchLen ← privateBranchLen + 1
  if ∆prev = 0 and privateBranchLen = 2 then            (Was tie with branch of 1)
    publish all of the private chain                    (Pool wins due to the lead of 1)
    privateBranchLen ← 0
    Mine at the new head of the private chain.
    
on Others found a block
  ∆prev ← length(private chain) − length(public chain)
  append new block to public chain
  if ∆prev = 0 then                             (they win)
    private chain ← public chain
    privateBranchLen ← 0
  else if ∆prev = 1 then
    publish last block of the private chain         (Now same length. Try our luck)
  else if ∆prev = 2 then
    publish all of the private chain                  (Pool wins due to the lead of 1)
    privateBranchLen ← 0 
  else
    publish first unpublished block in private block.       (∆prev > 2)
Mine at the head of the private chain.
